# Event Sourcing with Spring Boot Microservices

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **event sourcing** strategy using **Spring Boot microservices**. The application consists of two services:
- **order-service**: Handles order creation and confirmation.
- **shipping-service**: Manages shipping and delivery processes.

Both services communicate asynchronously using **Apache Kafka**, showcasing an event-driven architecture for order lifecycle management.

---

## What is Event Sourcing?

**Event Sourcing** is an architectural pattern where all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of events.  
Instead of only saving the current state, it records each state change as an event, which can:
- Reconstruct past states.
- Replay events to restore or predict system behavior.

---

## Why Use Event Sourcing?

Traditional systems only retain the latest state, losing the history of transitions. For example:
- An order may transition through `CREATED → CONFIRMED → SHIPPED → DELIVERED`.
- Without event sourcing, previous states like `CREATED` or `CONFIRMED` are lost, making it hard to audit or troubleshoot.

**Benefits of Event Sourcing:**
- **Accurate Auditing**: Complete history of state changes.
- **Debugging Aid**: Understand the sequence of actions leading to a specific state.
- **State Recovery**: Replay events to recover or analyze past states.

## Demo Application Design

### Architecture Overview

- **order-service**: Publishes events to Kafka when orders are created or confirmed.
- **shipping-service**: Listens to order events from Kafka and processes shipping actions.

---

## Order Microservice (`order-service`)

### Overview
The `order-service` handles:
- Order creation.
- Order confirmation.

### Key Dependencies
- Spring Boot Web
- Spring Boot Data MongoDB
- Spring Kafka
- Lombok
- Spring Boot Devtools

### Configuration Highlights
```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: order-service
  kafka:
    template:
      default-topic: order-events
server:
  port: 8081
```

### Kafka Producer Settings
```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer
```

### APIs and Their Functions
- **POST `/orders/create`**: Creates a new order and publishes an event.
- **PUT `/orders/confirm/{orderId}`**: Confirms an order and publishes an event.

### Serialization Details
- **Key Serializer**: Converts keys into strings (suitable for Kafka's message keys).  
- **Value Serializer**: Converts order data into JSON strings for efficient transmission.

---

## Shipping Microservice (`shipping-service`)

### Overview
The `shipping-service` processes:
- Orders confirmed by the `order-service`.
- Shipping and delivery of orders.

### Key Dependencies
Same as `order-service`, focusing on Kafka listeners and MongoDB for persistence.

### Configuration Highlights
```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    consumer:
      group-id: shipping-service
server:
  port: 8082
```

### Kafka Consumer Settings
```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    consumer:
      key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
      value-deserializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.ErrorHandlingDeserializer
      properties:
        spring.deserializer.key.delegate.class: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
        spring.deserializer.value.delegate.class: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonDeserializer
        spring.json.trusted.packages: '*'
```

### APIs and Their Functions
- **POST `/shipping/ship/{orderId}`**: Automatically triggered by Kafka listener when an order is confirmed. Ships the order.
- **POST `/shipping/deliver/{orderId}`**: Manually triggers the delivery of an order.

### Deserialization Details
- **Key Deserializer**: Converts message keys back to strings.  
- **Value Deserializer**: Converts JSON strings back into order event objects, while handling errors effectively.

## Testing the Application

### Prerequisites
1. Start **MongoDB**, **Zookeeper**, and **Kafka**.
2. Refer to `notes.txt` for setup instructions.

### Steps to Test
1. Start both microservices:
   - `order-service` runs on port `8081`.
   - `shipping-service` runs on port `8082`.
2. Use **Postman** or any API testing tool to simulate API calls:
   - **Create an order**:
     ```http
     POST http://localhost:8081/orders/create
     Body:
     {
       "orderId": "ORD1234",
       "name": "Mobile",
       "qty": 3,
       "price": 599.99,
       "userId": "USR93455"
     }
     ```
   - **Confirm the order**:
     ```http
     PUT http://localhost:8081/orders/confirm/ORD1234
     ```
   - **Ship the order**: Automatically triggered by the `shipping-service` upon order confirmation.
   - **Deliver the order**:
     ```http
     POST http://localhost:8082/shipping/deliver/ORD1234
     ```

## MongoDB Records

Each state change is logged as a separate event in MongoDB, providing a detailed event history for all orders.
