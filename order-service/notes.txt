# 1. How to start MongoDB in local
Open windows CMD and run "mongod"

# 2. How to start kafka in windows (go to your kafka folder C:\kafka):

# First start the Zookeper in CMD
.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

# Now start the kafka server in another CMD
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties


Errors I faced while starting Kafka and while deserializing:
1. If you are facing any errors while starting Kafka, I recommend you to delete log files from Kafka/logs folder 
Follow this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51644409/kafka-broker-fails-because-all-log-dirs-have-failed

2. Make sure your serializer class (OrderEvent in order-service) and de-serializer class (OrderEvent in shipping-service) should be in same package and namespace. Otherwise it will fail.
